markdown # Graphing Program This project is a simple web-based graphing application built using HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly.js. It allows users to input X and Y coordinates and plot two separate lines dynamically. ## Features - **Dynamic Plotting:** Users can add points to either of two lines (Line 1 or Line 2) by entering values and selecting the line. - **Real-Time Visualization:** The graph updates in real time with each added point, providing an interactive visual experience. - **Form Styling:** Custom CSS styles give the form a polished and user-friendly appearance. ## Technologies Used - **HTML5** for structure - **JavaScript** for interactivity - **Plotly.js** for graph plotting - **CSS** for styling ## How to Use 1. **Add Points**: Enter an X and Y coordinate, select the line number, and click "Add point." The plot will update to show the new point. 2. **View Lines**: The plotted lines are displayed on a responsive Plotly graph. 3. **Clear Inputs**: The form fields are cleared automatically after each submission to streamline point entry. ## Setup 1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start using the application. ## Screenshot ![Graphing Program Screenshot](screenshot.png) ## Future Enhancements - **Reset Option**: Add a reset button to clear the graph and start over. - **Point Removal**: Enable users to remove points from the plot. - **Graph Customization**: Allow customization of line colors and styles. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License.
