# Graphing Program

This project is a simple web-based graphing application built using HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly.js. It allows users to input X and Y coordinates and plot two separate lines dynamically.

## Features

- **Dynamic Plotting:** Users can add points to either of two lines (Line 1 or Line 2) by entering values and selecting the line.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** The graph updates in real time with each added point, providing an interactive visual experience.
- **Form Styling:** Custom CSS styles give the form a polished and user-friendly appearance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **JavaScript** for interactivity
- **Plotly.js** for graph plotting
- **CSS** for styling

## How to Use

1. **Add Points**: Enter an X and Y coordinate, select the line number, and click "Add point." The plot will update to show the new point.
2. **View Lines**: The plotted lines are displayed on a responsive Plotly graph.
3. **Clear Inputs**: The form fields are cleared automatically after each submission to streamline point entry.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open ```index.html``` in a web browser to start using the application.
